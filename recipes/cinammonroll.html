    <h2><u><b>Description</b></u></h2>
    <p>A cinnamon roll (also known as cinnamon bun, cinnamon swirl, cinnamon Danish and 
        cinnamon snail) is a sweet roll commonly served in Northern Europe (mainly in Nordic countries, but also
         in Austria and Germany) and North America.</p>
    <p>A cinnamon roll consists of a rolled sheet of yeast-leavened dough onto which a 
        cinnamon and sugar mixture is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The dough is then rolled, cut 
        into individual portions and baked. Th ingredients and method of preparation
        provide a robust and sweet flavor.</p>
    <h2><u><b>Ingredients</b></u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Powdered, granulated and Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Cream cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u><b>Steps</b></u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm 3/4 cup of milk to around 110 degrees F. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an
        electric mixer and sprinkle 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast on top. Add in 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 egg, 1 egg yolk and 1/4 cup of melted butter.
        Mix until well combined. Next stir in 3 cups of flour and 3/4 teaspoon of salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.</li>
        <li>Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes.
        Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. 
        If it's too sticky, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour. 
        If you do not want to use an electric mixer, you can use your
        hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel.
        Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface 
        and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread ¼ cup of softened butter over dough, 
        leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together 1 ½ tablespoons of cinnamon and 2/3 cups of brown sugar. Use your hands to 
        sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into 
        the butter.</li>
        <li>Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure 
        to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. </li>
        <li>Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. 
        You should get 9 large pieces.</li>
        <li>Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan.
        Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls 
        for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. Y Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. </li>
        <li>To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine 4 oz of cream cheese, 3 tablespoons of butter,
        ¾ cup of powdered sugar and ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately.</li>
