    <h2><u><b>Description</b></u></h2>
    <p>A chocolate brownie or simply a brownie is a square or rectangular 
    chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a variety of forms and 
    may be either fudgy or cakey. 
    They may also include nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate chips,
    or other ingredients. The brownie was developed in the United 
    States at the end of the 19th century and popularized there during the first half of the 20th century.

    <p>They are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with 
    ice cream (a la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with 
    powdered sugar and fudge. In North America, they are common homemade 
    treats and they are also popular in restaurants and coffeehouses.</p>
